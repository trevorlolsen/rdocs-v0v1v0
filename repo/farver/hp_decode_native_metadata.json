{"description":"Colours in R are internally encoded as integers when they are passed around\nto graphics devices. The encoding splits the 32 bit in the integer between\nred, green, blue, and alpha, so that each get 8 bit, equivalent to 256\nvalues. It is very seldom that an R user is subjected to this representation,\nbut it is present in the nativeRaster format which can be obtained from\ne.g. capturing the content of a graphic device (using dev.capture()) or reading\nin PNG files using png::readPNG(native = TRUE). It is very rare that you\nmight need to convert back and forth between this format, but it is provided\nhere for completeness.\n","example_call":"decode_native(colour)"}
