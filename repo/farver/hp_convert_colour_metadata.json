{"description":"This function lets you convert between different representations of colours.\nThe API is reminiscent of grDevices::convertColor(), but the performance is\nmuch better. It is not assured that grDevices::convertColor() and\nconvert_colour() provide numerically equivalent conversion at 16bit level as\nthe formula used are potentially slightly different. For all intend and\npurpose, the resulting colours will be equivalent though.\n","example_call":"convert_colour(colour, from, to, white_from = \"D65\", white_to = white_from)"}
