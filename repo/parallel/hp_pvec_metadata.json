{"description":"pvec parallelizes the execution of a function on vector elements\nby splitting the vector and submitting each part to one core. The\nfunction must be a vectorized map, i.e. it takes a vector input and\ncreates a vector output of exactly the same length as the input which\ndoesn't depend on the partition of the vector.\n","example_call":"pvec(v, FUN, ..., mc.set.seed = TRUE, mc.silent = FALSE,"}
