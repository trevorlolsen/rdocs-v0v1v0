{"description":"When testing code, it is not sufficient to check that results are correct,\nbut also that errors or warnings are signalled in appropriate\nsituations.  The functions described here provide a convenient\nfacility for doing so.  The three functions check that evaluating the\nsupplied expression produces an error, a warning or one of a\nspecified list of conditions, respectively.  If the assertion fails,\nan error is signalled.\n","example_call":"assertCondition(expr, ..., .exprString = .deparseTrim(substitute(expr),"}
