{"description":"When a \"trellis\" object is plotted, panels are always drawn in\nan order such that columns vary the fastest, then rows and then pages.\nAn optional function can be specified that determines, given the\ncolumn, row and page and other relevant information, the packet (if\nany) which should be used in that panel.  The function documented here\nimplements the default behaviour, which is to match panel order with\npacket order, determined by varying the first conditioning variable\nthe fastest, then the second, and so on.  This matching is performed\nafter any reordering and/or permutation of the conditioning variables.\n","example_call":"packet.panel.default(layout, condlevels, page, row, column, skip, all.pages.skip = TRUE)"}
