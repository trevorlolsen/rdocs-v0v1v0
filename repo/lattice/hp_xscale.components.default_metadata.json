{"description":"Lattice funtions provide control over how the plot axes are annotated\nthrough a common interface.  There are two levels of control.  The\nxscale.components and yscale.components arguments can be\nfunctions that determine tick mark locations and labels given a\npacket.  For more direct control, the axis argument can be a\nfunction that actually draws the axes.  The functions documented here\nare the defaults for these arguments.  They can additonally be used as\ncomponents of user written replacements.\n","example_call":"xscale.components.default(lim, packet.number = 0, packet.list = NULL, top = TRUE,"}
