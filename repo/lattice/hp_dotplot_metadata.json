{"description":"This help page documents several commonly used high-level Lattice\nfunctions.  xyplot produces bivariate scatterplots or\ntime-series plots, bwplot produces box-and-whisker plots,\ndotplot produces Cleveland dot plots, barchart produces\nbar plots, and stripplot produces one-dimensional scatterplots.\nAll these functions, along with other high-level Lattice functions,\nrespond to a common set of arguments that control conditioning,\nlayout, aspect ratio, legends, axis annotation, and many other details\nin a consistent manner.  These arguments are described extensively in\nthis help page, and should be used as the reference for other\nhigh-level functions as well.\n","example_call":"dotplot(x, data, ...)"}
