{"description":"These functions are intended to replace common low level traditional\ngraphics functions, primarily for use in panel functions.  The\noriginals can not be used (at least not easily) because lattice panel\nfunctions need to use grid graphics.  Low level drawing functions in\ngrid can be used directly as well, and is often more flexible.  These\nfunctions are provided for convenience and portability.\n","example_call":"panel.rect(...)"}
