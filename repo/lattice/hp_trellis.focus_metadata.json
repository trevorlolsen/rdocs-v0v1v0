{"description":"The classic Trellis paradigm is to plot the whole object at once,\nwithout the possibility of interacting with it afterwards.  However,\nby keeping track of the grid viewports where the panels and strips are\ndrawn, it is possible to go back to them afterwards and enhance them\none panel at a time.  These functions provide convenient interfaces to\nhelp in this.  Note that these are still experimental and the exact\ndetails may change in future.\n","example_call":"trellis.focus(name, column = stop(\"column must be specified\"), row = stop(\"row must be specified\"),"}
