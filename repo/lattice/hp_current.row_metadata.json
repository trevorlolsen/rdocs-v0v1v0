{"description":"Control over lattice plots are provided through a collection of user\nspecifiable functions that perform various tasks during the plotting.\nNot all information is available to all functions.  The functions\ndocumented here attempt to provide a consistent interface to access\nrelevant information from within these user specified functions,\nnamely those specified as the panel, strip and\naxis functions.  Note that this information is not available to\nthe prepanel function, which is executed prior to the actual\nplotting.\n","example_call":"current.row(prefix = lattice.getStatus(\"current.prefix\"))"}
