First, this function cannot\nbe called directly, and the body of the function created will contain\na stop call with this information.  Second, the group generic function\ncontains information about the known members of the group, used to\nkeep the members up to date when the group definition changes, through\nchanges in the search list or direct specification of methods, etc.\n","example_call":"setGroupGeneric(name, def = NULL, group = list(), valueClass = character(),"}
