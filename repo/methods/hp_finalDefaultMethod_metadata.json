{"description":"These functions create and manipulate MethodsList objects, the\nobjects formerly used in R to store methods for dispatch.  Use of\nthese objects is deprecated since R 3.2.0, as it will rarely be a\ngood idea.  Where methods dispatch is\nto be studied, see selectMethod.  For computations\nthat iterate over methods or over method signatures, see\nfindMethods, which returns a linearized methods list\nto hold method definitions, usually more convenient for iteration\nthan the recursive MethodsList objects.\n","example_call":"finalDefaultMethod(method)"}
