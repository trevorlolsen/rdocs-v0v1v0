{"description":"This function computes a locale-dependent sort key, which is an alternative\ncharacter representation of the string that, when ordered in the C locale\n(which orders using the underlying bytes directly), will give an equivalent\nordering to the original string. It is useful for enhancing algorithms\nthat sort only in the C locale (e.g., the strcmp function in libc)\nwith the ability to be locale-aware.\n","example_call":"stri_sort_key(str, ..., opts_collator = NULL)"}
