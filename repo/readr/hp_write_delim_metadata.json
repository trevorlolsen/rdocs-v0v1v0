{"description":"The <U+2060>write_*()<U+2060> family of functions are an improvement to analogous function such\nas write.csv() because they are approximately twice as fast. Unlike write.csv(),\nthese functions do not include row names as a column in the written file.\nA generic function, output_column(), is applied to each variable\nto coerce columns to suitable output.\n","example_call":"write_delim(x, file, delim = \" \", na = \"NA\", append = FALSE, col_names = !append,"}
