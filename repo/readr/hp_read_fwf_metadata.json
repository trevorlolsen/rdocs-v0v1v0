{"description":"A fixed width file can be a very compact representation of numeric data.\nIt's also very fast to parse, because every field is in the same place in\nevery line. Unfortunately, it's painful to parse because you need to\ndescribe the length of every field. Readr aims to make it as easy as possible\nby providing a number of different ways to describe the field structure.\n","example_call":"read_fwf(file, col_positions = fwf_empty(file, skip, n = guess_max),"}
