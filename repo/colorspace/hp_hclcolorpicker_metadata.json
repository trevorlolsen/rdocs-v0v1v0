Colors can be entered by specifying the hue (H), chroma (C),\nand luminance (L) values via sliders, by entering an RGB hex code, or by clicking on a color in the\nhue-chroma or luminance-chroma plane. It is also possible to select individual colors and add them\nto a palette for comparison and future reference.\n","example_call":"hclcolorpicker(shiny.trace = FALSE)"}
