{"description":"Will return position and types of unhandled Control Sequences in a\ncharacter vector.  Unhandled sequences may cause fansi to interpret strings\nin a way different to your display.  See fansi for details.  Functions that\ninterpret Special Sequences (CSI SGR or OSC hyperlinks) might omit bad\nSpecial Sequences or some of their components in output substrings,\nparticularly if they are leading or trailing.  Some functions are more\ntolerant of bad inputs than others.  For example nchar_ctl will not\nreport unsupported colors because it only cares about counts or widths.\nunhandled_ctl will report all potentially problematic sequences.\n","example_call":"unhandled_ctl(x, term.cap = getOption(\"fansi.term.cap\", dflt_term_cap()))"}
