{"description":"state_at_end reads through strings computing the accumulated SGR and\nOSC hyperlinks, and outputs the active state at the end of them.\nclose_state produces the sequence that closes any SGR active and OSC\nhyperlinks at the end of each input string.  If normalize = FALSE\n(default), it will emit the reset code \"ESC[0m\" if any SGR is present.\nIt is more interesting for closing SGRs if normalize = TRUE.  Unlike\nstate_at_end and other functions close_state has no concept of carry:\nit will only emit closing sequences for states explicitly active at the end\nof a string.\n","example_call":"state_at_end(x, warn = getOption(\"fansi.warn\", TRUE), term.cap = getOption(\"fansi.term.cap\","}
