{"description":"This is a convenience function designed for use within an rmarkdown\ndocument.  It overrides the knitr output hooks by using\nknitr::knit_hooks$set.  It replaces the hooks with ones that convert\nControl Sequences into HTML.  In addition to replacing the hook functions,\nthis will output a <STYLE> HTML block to stdout.  These two actions are\nside effects as a result of which R chunks in the rmarkdown document that\ncontain CSI SGR are shown in their HTML equivalent form.\n","example_call":"set_knit_hooks(hooks, which = \"output\", proc.fun = function(x, class) html_code_block(to_html(html_esc(x)),"}
