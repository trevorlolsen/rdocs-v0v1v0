{"description":"glimpse() is like a transposed version of print():\ncolumns run down the page, and data runs across.\nThis makes it possible to see every column in a data frame.\nIt's a little like str() applied to a data frame\nbut it tries to show you as much data as possible.\n(And it always shows the underlying data, even when applied\nto a remote data source.)\n","example_call":"glimpse(x, width = NULL, ...)"}
