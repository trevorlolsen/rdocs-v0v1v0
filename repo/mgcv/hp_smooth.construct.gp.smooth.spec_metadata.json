{"description":"Gaussian process/kriging models based on simple covariance functions can be written in a very similar form to thin plate and Duchon spline models (e.g. Handcock, Meier, Nychka, 1994), and low rank versions produced by the eigen approximation method of Wood (2003). Kammann and Wand (2003) suggest a particularly simple form of the Matern covariance function with only a single smoothing parameter to estimate, and this class implements this and other similar models.  \n","example_call":"smooth.construct.gp.smooth.spec(object, data, knots)"}
