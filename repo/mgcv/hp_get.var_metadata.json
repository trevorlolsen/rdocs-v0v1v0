{"description":" This routine takes a text string and a data frame or list. It first sees if the \nstring is the name of a variable in the data frame/ list. If it is then the value of this variable is returned. \nOtherwise the routine tries to evaluate the expression within the data.frame/list (but nowhere else) and if \nsuccessful returns the result. If neither step works then NULL is returned. The routine is useful for\nprocessing gam formulae. If the variable is a matrix then it is coerced to a numeric vector, by default.","example_call":"get.var(txt, data, vecMat = TRUE)"}
