{"description":" Performs hypothesis tests relating to one or more fitted\ngam objects. For a single fitted gam object, Wald tests of\nthe significance of each parametric and smooth term are performed, so interpretation \nis analogous to drop1 rather than anova.lm (i.e. it's like type III ANOVA, \nrather than a sequential type I ANOVA). Otherwise the fitted models are compared using an analysis of deviance table or GLRT test: this latter approach should not be use to test the significance of terms which can be penalized \nto zero. Models to be compared should be fitted to the same data using the same smoothing parameter selection method.\n","example_call":"anova.gam(object, ..., dispersion = NULL, test = NULL, freq = FALSE)"}
