{"description":"gam can deal with simple independent random effects, by exploiting the link \nbetween smooths and random effects to treat random effects as smooths. s(x,bs=\"re\") implements \nthis. Such terms can can have any number of predictors, which can be any mixture of numeric or factor \nvariables. The terms produce a parametric interaction of the predictors, and penalize the corresponding \ncoefficients with a multiple of the identity matrix, corresponding to an assumption of i.i.d. normality.\nSee details.\n","example_call":"Predict.matrix.random.effect(object, data)"}
