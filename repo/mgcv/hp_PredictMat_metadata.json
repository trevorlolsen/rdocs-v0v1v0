{"description":" Wrapper functions for construction of and prediction from smooth\nterms in a GAM. The purpose of the wrappers is to allow user-transparant\nre-parameterization of smooth terms, in order to allow identifiability\nconstraints to be absorbed into the parameterization of each term, if required.\nThe routine also handles <U+2018>by<U+2019> variables and construction of identifiability constraints automatically, \nalthough this behaviour can be over-ridden.\n","example_call":"PredictMat(object, data, n = nrow(data))"}
