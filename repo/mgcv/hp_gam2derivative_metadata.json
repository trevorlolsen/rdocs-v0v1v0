{"description":"Estimation of GAM smoothing parameters is most stable if\noptimization of the UBRE/AIC or GCV score is outer to the penalized iteratively\nre-weighted least squares scheme used to estimate the model given smoothing \nparameters. These functions evaluate the GCV/UBRE/AIC score of a GAM model, given\nsmoothing parameters, in a manner suitable for use by optim or nlm.\nNot normally called directly, but rather service routines for gam.outer.\n","example_call":"gam2derivative(lsp, args, ...)"}
