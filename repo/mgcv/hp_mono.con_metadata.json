{"description":"Finds linear constraints sufficient for monotonicity (and\noptionally upper and/or lower boundedness) of a cubic regression\nspline. The basis representation assumed is that given by the\ngam, \"cr\" basis: that is the spline has a set of knots,\nwhich have fixed x values, but the y values of which constitute the\nparameters of the spline.\n","example_call":"mono.con(x, up = TRUE, lower = NA, upper = NA)"}
