{"description":"gam can use univariate penalized cubic regression spline smooths, specified via terms like\ns(x,bs=\"cr\"). s(x,bs=\"cs\") specifies a penalized cubic regression spline which has had its penalty modified \nto shrink towards zero at high enough smoothing parameters (as the smoothing parameter goes to infinity a normal cubic spline tends to a \nstraight line.) s(x,bs=\"cc\") specifies a cyclic penalized cubic regression spline smooth.\n","example_call":"smooth.construct.cc.smooth.spec(object, data, knots)"}
