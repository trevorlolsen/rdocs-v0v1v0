{"description":"Mainly intended for internal use in specifying location scale models.\nLet g(mu) = lp, where lp is the linear predictor, and g is the link\nfunction. Assume that we have calculated the derivatives of the log-likelihood wrt mu.\nThis function uses the chain rule to calculate the derivatives of the log-likelihood wrt\nlp. See trind.generator for array packing conventions. \n","example_call":"gamlss.etamu(l1, l2, l3 = NULL, l4 = NULL, ig1, g2, g3 = NULL, g4 = NULL,"}
