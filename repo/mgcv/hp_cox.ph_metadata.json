{"description":"The cox.ph family implements the Cox Proportional Hazards model with Peto's \ncorrection for ties, optional stratification, and estimation by penalized partial likelihood maximization, for use with \ngam. In the model formula, event time is the response. Under stratification the response has two columns: time\nand a numeric index for stratum.  The weights vector provides \nthe censoring information (0 for censoring, 1 for event). cox.ph deals with the case in which each subject has\none event/censoring time and one row of covariate values. When each subject has several time dependent\ncovariates see cox.pht. \n","example_call":"cox.ph(link = \"identity\")"}
