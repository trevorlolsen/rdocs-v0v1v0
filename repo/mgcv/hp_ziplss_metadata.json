{"description":"The ziplss family implements a zero inflated (hurdle) Poisson model in which one linear predictor \ncontrols the probability of presence  and the other controls the mean given presence.\nUseable only with gam, the linear predictors are specified via a list of formulae. \nShould be used with care: simply having a large number of zeroes is not an indication of zero inflation. \n","example_call":"ziplss(link = list(\"identity\", \"identity\"))"}
