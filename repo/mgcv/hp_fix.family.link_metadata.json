{"description":" Generalized Additive Model fitting by <U+2018>outer<U+2019> iteration,\nrequires extra derivatives of the variance and link functions to be \nadded to family objects. The first 3 functions add what is needed. Model checking can\nbe aided by adding quantile and random deviate generating functions to the family. \nThe final two functions do this.\n","example_call":"fix.family.link(fam)"}
