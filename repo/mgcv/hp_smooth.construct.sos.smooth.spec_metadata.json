{"description":"gam can use isotropic smooths on the sphere, via terms like \ns(la,lo,bs=\"sos\",m=2,k=100). There must be exactly 2 arguments to such a smooth. \nThe first is taken to be latitude (in degrees) and the second longitude (in degrees). \nm (default 0) is an integer in the range -1 to 4 determining the order of the penalty used. \nFor m>0, (m+2)/2 is the penalty order, with m=2 equivalent to the usual second \nderivative penalty. m=0 signals to use the 2nd order spline on the sphere, computed by \nWendelberger's (1981) method. m = -1 results in a Duchon.spline being \nused (with m=2 and s=1/2), following an unpublished suggestion of Jean Duchon.\n","example_call":"smooth.construct.sos.smooth.spec(object, data, knots)"}
