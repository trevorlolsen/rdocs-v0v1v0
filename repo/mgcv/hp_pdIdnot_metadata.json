{"description":" This set of functions is a modification of the  pdMat class pdIdent\nfrom library nlme. The modification is to replace the log parameterization used in pdMat\nwith a notLog2 parameterization, since the latter avoids\nindefiniteness in the likelihood and associated convergence problems: the\nparameters also relate to variances rather than standard deviations, for\nconsistency with the pdTens class. The functions are particularly useful for\nworking with Generalized Additive Mixed Models where variance parameters/smoothing parameters can\nbe very large or very small, so that overflow or underflow can be a problem.\n","example_call":"pdIdnot(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = sys.frame(sys.parent()))"}
