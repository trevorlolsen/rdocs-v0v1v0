{"description":"Tweedie families, designed for use with gam from the mgcv library.\nRestricted to variance function powers between 1 and 2. A useful alternative to quasi when a\nfull likelihood is desirable. Tweedie is for use with fixed p. tw is for use when p\nis to be estimated during fitting. For fixed p between 1 and 2 the Tweedie is an exponential family \ndistribution with variance given by the mean to the power p.\n","example_call":"Tweedie(p = 1, link = power(0))"}
