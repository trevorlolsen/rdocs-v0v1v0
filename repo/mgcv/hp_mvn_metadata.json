{"description":"Family for use with gam implementing smooth multivariate Gaussian regression. \nThe means for each dimension are given by a separate linear predictor, which may contain smooth components. Extra linear predictors may also be specified giving terms which are shared between components (see formula.gam). The Choleski factor of the response precision matrix is estimated as part of fitting.\n","example_call":"mvn(d = 2)"}
