{"description":"Smooth terms in a GAM formula are turned into smooth specification objects of \nclass xx.smooth.spec during processing of the formula. Each of these objects is\nconverted to a smooth object using an appropriate smooth.construct function. New smooth classes \ncan be added by writing a new smooth.construct method function and a corresponding \nPredict.matrix method function (see example code below).\n","example_call":"smooth.construct2(object, data, knots)"}
