{"description":"This set of functions implements an nlme library pdMat class to allow\ntensor product smooths to be estimated by lme as called by gamm. Tensor product smooths\nhave a penalty matrix made up of a weighted sum of penalty matrices, where the weights are the smoothing \nparameters. In the mixed model formulation the penalty matrix is the inverse of the covariance matrix for \nthe random effects of a term, and the smoothing parameters (times a half) are variance parameters to be estimated. \nIt's not possible to transform the problem to make the required random effects covariance matrix look like one of the standard \npdMat classes: hence the need for the pdTens class. A notLog2 parameterization ensures that \nthe parameters are positive. \n","example_call":"pdTens(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = sys.frame(sys.parent()))"}
