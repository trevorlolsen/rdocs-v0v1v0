{"description":"gamm works by transforming a GAMM into something \nthat can be estimated by lme, but this involves creating new \nvariables, the names of which should not clash with the names of other \nvariables on which the model depends. This simple service routine checks a \nsuggested name against a list of those in use, and if neccesary modifies it \nso that there is no clash.","example_call":"new.name(proposed, old.names)"}
