{"description":" The thin plate spline penalties give zero penalty to some\nfunctions. The space of these functions is spanned by a set of\npolynomial terms. null.space.dimension finds the dimension of this space, M, given\nthe number of covariates that the smoother is a function of, d,\nand the order of the smoothing penalty, m. If m does not\nsatisfy 2m>d then the smallest possible dimension\nfor the null space is found given d and the requirement that\nthe smooth should be visually smooth.  \n","example_call":"null.space.dimension(d, m)"}
