{"description":" Takes a fitted gam object produced by gam() \nand produces predictions given a new set of values for the model covariates \nor the original values used for the model fit. Predictions can be accompanied\nby standard errors, based on the posterior distribution of the model\ncoefficients. The routine can optionally return the matrix by which the model\ncoefficients must be pre-multiplied in order to yield the values of the linear predictor at\nthe supplied covariate values: this is useful for obtaining credible regions\nfor quantities derived from the model (e.g. derivatives of smooths), and for lookup table prediction outside\nR (see example code below).","example_call":"predict.gam(object, newdata, type = \"link\", se.fit = FALSE, terms = NULL,"}
