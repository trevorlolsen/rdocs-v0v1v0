{"description":" Fits a generalized additive model (GAM) to a very large\ndata set, the term <U+2018>GAM<U+2019> being taken to include any quadratically penalized GLM (the extended families\nlisted in family.mgcv can also be used).  \nThe degree of smoothness of model terms is estimated as part of\nfitting. In use the function is much like gam, except that the numerical methods\nare designed for datasets containing upwards of several tens of thousands of data (see Wood, Goude and Shaw, 2015). The advantage \nof bam is much lower memory footprint than gam, but it can also be much faster, \nfor large datasets. bam can also compute on a cluster set up by the parallel package.\n","example_call":"bam(formula, family = gaussian(), data = list(), weights = NULL,"}
