{"description":" This is an internal function of package mgcv. It is a modification\nof the function glm.fit, designed to be called from gam when perfomance iteration is selected (not the default). The major\nmodification is that rather than solving a weighted least squares problem at each IRLS step, \na weighted, penalized least squares problem\nis solved at each IRLS step with smoothing parameters associated with each penalty chosen by GCV or UBRE,\nusing routine magic. \nFor further information on usage see code for gam. Some regularization of the \nIRLS weights is also permitted as a way of addressing identifiability related problems (see \ngam.control). Negative binomial parameter estimation is\nsupported.\n","example_call":"gam.fit(G, start = NULL, etastart = NULL, mustart = NULL, family = gaussian(),"}
