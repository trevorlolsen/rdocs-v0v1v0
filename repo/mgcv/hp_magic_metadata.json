{"description":"Function to efficiently estimate smoothing parameters in generalized\nridge regression problems with multiple (quadratic) penalties, by GCV \nor UBRE. The function uses Newton's method in multi-dimensions, backed up by \nsteepest descent to iteratively adjust the smoothing parameters for each penalty \n(one penalty may have a smoothing parameter fixed at 1). \n","example_call":"magic(y, X, sp, S, off, L = NULL, lsp0 = NULL, rank = NULL,"}
