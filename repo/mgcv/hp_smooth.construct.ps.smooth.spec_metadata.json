{"description":"gam can use univariate P-splines as proposed by Eilers and Marx (1996), \nspecified via terms like s(x,bs=\"ps\"). These terms use B-spline bases \npenalized by discrete penalties applied directly to \nthe basis coefficients. Cyclic P-splines are specified by model terms like s(x,bs=\"cp\",...). \nThese bases can be used in tensor product smooths (see te).\n","example_call":"smooth.construct.ps.smooth.spec(object, data, knots)"}
