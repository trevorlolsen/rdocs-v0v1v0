{"description":"gam can use adaptive smooths of one or two variables, specified \nvia terms like s(...,bs=\"ad\",...). (gamm can not use such terms <U+2014> check out \npackage AdaptFit if this is a problem.) The basis for such a term is a (tensor product of) \np-spline(s) or cubic regression spline(s). Discrete P-spline type penalties are applied directly to the coefficients \nof the basis, but the penalties themselves have a basis representation, allowing the strength of the\npenalty to vary with the covariates. The coefficients of the penalty basis are the smoothing parameters.\n","example_call":"smooth.construct.ad.smooth.spec(object, data, knots)"}
