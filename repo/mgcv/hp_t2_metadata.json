{"description":" Alternative to te for defining tensor product smooths\nin a gam formula. Results in a construction in which the penalties are \nnon-overlapping multiples of identity matrices (with some rows and columns zeroed). \nThe construction, which is due to Fabian Scheipl (mgcv implementation, 2010), is analogous to Smoothing Spline ANOVA \n(Gu, 2002), but using low rank penalized regression spline marginals. The main advantage of this construction \nis that it is useable with gamm4 from package gamm4.\n","example_call":"t2(..., k = NA, bs = \"cr\", m = NA, d = NA, by = NA, xt = NULL,"}
