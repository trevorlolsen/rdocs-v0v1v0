{"description":" It is common practice in statistical optimization to use log-parameterizations when a \nparameter ought to be positive. i.e. if an optimization parameter a should be non-negative then \nwe use a=exp(b) and optimize with respect to the unconstrained parameter b. This often works \nwell, but it does imply a rather limited working range for b: using 8 byte doubles, for example, \nif b's magnitude gets much above 700 then a overflows or underflows. This can cause \nproblems for numerical optimization methods. \n","example_call":"notExp(x)"}
