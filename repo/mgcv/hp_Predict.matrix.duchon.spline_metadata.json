{"description":"Thin plate spline smoothers are a special case of the isotropic splines discussed in Duchon (1977). A subset of this more \ngeneral class can be invoked by terms like s(x,z,bs=\"ds\",m=c(1,.5) in a gam model formula.\nIn the notation of Duchon (1977) m is given by m[1] (default value 2), while s is given by m[2] (default value 0).\n","example_call":"Predict.matrix.duchon.spline(object, data)"}
