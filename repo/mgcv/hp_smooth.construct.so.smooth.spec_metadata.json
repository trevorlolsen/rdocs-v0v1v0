{"description":" Sets up basis functions and wiggliness penalties for\nsoap film smoothers (Wood, Bravington and Hedley, 2008). Soap film smoothers are based on the idea of\nconstructing a 2-D smooth as a film of soap connecting a smoothly varying\nclosed boundary. Unless smoothing very heavily, the film is distorted towards\nthe data. The smooths are designed not to smooth across boundary features (peninsulas,\nfor example).\n","example_call":"smooth.construct.so.smooth.spec(object, data, knots)"}
