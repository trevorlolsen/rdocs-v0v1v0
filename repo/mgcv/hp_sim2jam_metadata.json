{"description":"Facilities to auto-generate model specification code and associated data to simulate with GAMs in JAGS (or BUGS). This is useful for inference about models with complex random effects structure best coded in JAGS. It is a very innefficient approach to making inferences about standard GAMs. The idea is that jagam generates template JAGS code, and associated data, for the smooth part of the model. This template is then directly edited to include other stochastic components. After simulation with the resulting model, facilities are provided for plotting and prediction with the model smooth components. \n","example_call":"sim2jam(sam, pregam, edf.type = 2, burnin = 0)"}
