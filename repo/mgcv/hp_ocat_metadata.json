{"description":"Family for use with gam or bam, implementing regression for ordered categorical data.\nA linear predictor provides the expected value of a latent variable following a logistic distribution. The \nprobability of this latent variable lying between certain cut-points provides the probability of the ordered \ncategorical variable being of the corresponding category. The cut-points are estimated along side the model \nsmoothing parameters (using the same criterion). The observed categories are coded 1, 2, 3, ... up to the \nnumber of categories. \n","example_call":"ocat(theta = NULL, link = \"identity\", R = NULL)"}
