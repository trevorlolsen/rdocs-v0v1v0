{"description":"unload() attempts to cleanly unload a package, including unloading\nits namespace, deleting S4 class definitions and unloading any loaded\nDLLs. Unfortunately S4 classes are not really designed to be cleanly\nunloaded, and so we have to manually modify the class dependency graph in\norder for it to work - this works on the cases for which we have tested\nbut there may be others.  Similarly, automated DLL unloading is best tested\nfor simple scenarios (particularly with useDynLib(pkgname) and may\nfail in other cases. If you do encounter a failure, please file a bug report\nat https://github.com/r-lib/pkgload/issues.\n","example_call":"unregister(package = pkg_name())"}
