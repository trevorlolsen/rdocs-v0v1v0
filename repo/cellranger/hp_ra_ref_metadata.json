{"description":"The ra_ref class is used to represent a single relative, absolute, or\nmixed cell reference, presumably found in a formula. When row_abs is\nTRUE, it means that row_ref identifies a specific row in an\nabsolute sense. When row_abs is FALSE, it means that\nrow_ref holds a positive, zero, or negative offset relative to the\naddress of the cell containing the formula that contains the associated cell\nreference. Ditto for col_abs and col_ref.\n","example_call":"ra_ref(row_ref = 1L, row_abs = TRUE, col_ref = 1L, col_abs = TRUE,"}
