{"description":"The cell_addr class is used to hold the absolute row and column\nlocation for one or more cells. An object of class cell_addr is a list\nwith two components of equal length, named row and col,\nconsisting of integers greater than or equal to one or NA. This is in\ncontrast to the ra_ref class, which holds a representation of a\nsingle absolute, relative, or mixed cell reference from, e.g., a formula.\n","example_call":"cell_addr(row, col)"}
