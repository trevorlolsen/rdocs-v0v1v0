The extent can be specified directly via\ndims or indirectly via the input object. Specification via\ninput anticipates a write operation into the spreadsheet. If\ninput is one-dimensional, the byrow argument controls whether\nthe rectangle will extend down from the anchor or to the right. If\ninput is two-dimensional, the col_names argument controls\nwhether cells will be reserved for column or variable names. If\ncol_names is unspecified, default behavior is to set it to TRUE\nif input has columns names and FALSE otherwise.\n","example_call":"anchored(anchor = \"A1\", dim = c(1L, 1L), input = NULL, col_names = NULL,"}
