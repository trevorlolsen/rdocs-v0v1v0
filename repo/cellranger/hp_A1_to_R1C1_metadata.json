{"description":"Convert cell reference strings from A1 to R1C1 format. Strictly speaking,\nthis only makes sense for absolute references, such as \"$B$4\". Why?\nBecause otherwise, we'd have to know the host cell of the reference. Set\nstrict = FALSE to relax and treat pure relative references, like\n(\"B4\"), as if they are absolute. Mixed references, like\n(\"B$4\"), will always return NA, no matter the value of\nstrict.\n","example_call":"A1_to_R1C1(x, strict = TRUE)"}
