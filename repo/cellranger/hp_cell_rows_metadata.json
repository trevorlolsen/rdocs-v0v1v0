{"description":"How does this differ from cell_limits? Here the input can have\nlength greater than 2, i.e. the rows can be specified as 1:n. If the\nlength is greater than 2, both the min and max are taken with NA.rm =\nTRUE. Note it is not possible to request non-contiguous rows, i.e. rows 1,\n2, and 5. In this case, the requested rows will run from the minimum of 1 to\nthe maximum of 5.\n","example_call":"cell_rows(x)"}
