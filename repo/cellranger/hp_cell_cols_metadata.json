{"description":"How does this differ from cell_limits? Two ways. First, the\ninput can have length greater than 2, i.e. the columns can be specified as\n1:n. If the length is greater than 2, both the min and max are taken\nwith NA.rm = TRUE. Note it is not possible to request non-contiguous\ncolumns, i.e. columns 1, 2, and 5. In this case, the requested columns will\nrun from the minimum of 1 to the maximum of 5. Second, the input can be given\nin the letter-based format spreadsheets use to label columns.\n","example_call":"cell_cols(x)"}
