{"description":"This function is a constructor for the pdIdent class,\nrepresenting a multiple of the identity positive-definite matrix. \nThe matrix associated with object is represented by 1\nunrestricted parameter, given by the logarithm of the square-root of\nthe diagonal value. When value is \nnumeric(0), an uninitialized pdMat object, a one-sided\nformula, or a vector of character strings, object is returned\nas an uninitialized pdIdent object (with just some of its\nattributes and its class defined) and needs to have its coefficients\nassigned later, generally using the coef or matrix replacement\nfunctions. If value is an initialized pdMat object,\nobject will be constructed from\nas.matrix(value). Finally, if value is a numeric value,\nit is assumed to represent the unrestricted coefficient of the\nunderlying positive-definite  matrix.  \n","example_call":"pdIdent(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = parent.frame())"}
