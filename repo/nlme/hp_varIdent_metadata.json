{"description":"This function is a constructor for the varIdent class,\nrepresenting a constant variance function structure. If no grouping\nfactor is present in form, the variance function is constant\nand equal to one, and no coefficients required to represent it. When\nform includes a grouping factor with M > 1 levels, the\nvariance function allows M different variances, one  for each level of\nthe factor. For identifiability reasons, the coefficients of the\nvariance function represent the ratios between the variances and a\nreference variance (corresponding to a reference group\nlevel). Therefore, only M-1 coefficients are needed to represent\nthe variance function. By default, if the elements in value are\nunnamed, the first group level is taken as the reference level.\n","example_call":"varIdent(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, fixed = NULL)"}
