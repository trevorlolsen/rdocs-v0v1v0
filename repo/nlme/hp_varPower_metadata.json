{"description":"This function is a constructor for the varPower class,\nrepresenting a power variance function structure. Letting\nv denote the variance covariate and \\sigma^2(v)\ndenote the variance function evaluated at v, the power\nvariance function is defined as \\sigma^2(v) = |v|^{2\\theta}, where \\theta is the variance \nfunction coefficient. When a grouping factor is present, a different\n\\theta is used for each factor level.\n","example_call":"varPower(value = numeric(0), form = ~fitted(.), fixed = NULL)"}
