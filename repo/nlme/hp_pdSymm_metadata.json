{"description":"This function is a constructor for the pdSymm class,\nrepresenting a general positive-definite matrix. If the matrix\nassociated with object is of dimension n, it is\nrepresented by n(n+1)/2 unrestricted parameters,\nusing the matrix-logarithm parametrization described in Pinheiro and\nBates (1996). When value is numeric(0), an uninitialized\npdMat object, a one-sided\nformula, or a vector of character strings, object is returned\nas an uninitialized pdSymm object (with just some of its\nattributes and its class defined) and needs to have its coefficients\nassigned later, generally using the coef or matrix replacement\nfunctions. If value is an initialized pdMat object,\nobject will be constructed from\nas.matrix(value). Finally, if value is a numeric vector,\nit is assumed to represent the unrestricted coefficients of the\nmatrix-logarithm parametrization of the underlying positive-definite\nmatrix.  \n","example_call":"pdSymm(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = parent.frame())"}
