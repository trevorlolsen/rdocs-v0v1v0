{"description":"When only one fitted model object is present, a data frame with the\nnumerator degrees of freedom, denominator degrees of\nfreedom, F-values, and P-values for Wald tests for the terms in the\nmodel (when Terms and L are NULL), a combination\nof model terms (when Terms in not NULL), or linear\ncombinations of the model coefficients (when L is not\nNULL).  Otherwise, when multiple fitted objects are being\ncompared, a data frame with the degrees of freedom, the (restricted)\nlog-likelihood, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of each object is returned.  If\ntest=TRUE, whenever two consecutive  objects have different\nnumber of degrees of freedom, a likelihood ratio statistic with the\nassociated p-value is included in the returned data frame.\n","example_call":"anova.lme(object, ..., test = TRUE, type = c(\"sequential\", \"marginal\"),"}
