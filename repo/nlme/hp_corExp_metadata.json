{"description":"This function is a constructor for the \"corExp\" class,\nrepresenting an exponential spatial correlation structure. Letting\nd denote the range and n denote the nugget\neffect, the correlation between two observations a distance\nr apart is \\exp(-r/d) when no nugget effect\nis present and (1-n) \\exp(-r/d) when a nugget\neffect is assumed. Objects created using this constructor must later be\ninitialized using the appropriate Initialize method.\n","example_call":"corExp(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, nugget = FALSE, metric = c(\"euclidean\","}
