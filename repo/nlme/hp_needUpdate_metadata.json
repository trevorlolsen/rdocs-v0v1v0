{"description":"This function is generic; method functions can be written to handle\nspecific classes of objects. By default, it tries to extract a\nneedUpdate attribute of object. If this is NULL\nor FALSE it returns FALSE; else it returns TRUE.\nUpdating of objects usually takes place in iterative algorithms in\nwhich auxiliary quantities associated with the object, and not being\noptimized over, may change.\n","example_call":"needUpdate(object)"}
