{"description":"This function is a constructor for the pdBlocked class,\nrepresenting a positive-definite block-diagonal matrix. Each\nblock-diagonal element of the underlying  matrix is itself a\npositive-definite matrix and is represented internally as an\nindividual pdMat object. When value is\nnumeric(0), a list of uninitialized pdMat objects, a\nlist of one-sided formulas, or a list of vectors \nof character strings,  object is returned\nas an uninitialized pdBlocked object (with just some of its\nattributes and its class defined) and needs to have its coefficients\nassigned later, generally using the coef or matrix replacement\nfunctions. If value is a list of  initialized pdMat\nobjects, object will be constructed from the list obtained by\napplying as.matrix to each of the pdMat elements of\nvalue. Finally, if value is a list of numeric vectors,\nthey are assumed to represent the unrestricted coefficients\nof the block-diagonal elements of the  underlying positive-definite\nmatrix.  \n","example_call":"pdBlocked(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = parent.frame(),"}
