{"description":"This function is a constructor for the pdNatural class,\nrepresenting a general positive-definite matrix, using a natural\nparametrization . If the matrix associated with object is of\ndimension n, it is represented by n(n+1)/2\nparameters. Letting \\sigma_{ij} denote the ij-th\nelement of the underlying positive definite matrix and\n\\rho_{ij}=\\sigma_{i}/\\sqrt{\\sigma_{ii}\\sigma_{jj}},\\;i\\neq j denote the associated\n\"correlations\", the \"natural\" parameters are given by\n\\sqrt{\\sigma_{ii}}, \\;i=1,\\ldots,n and\n\\log((1+\\rho_{ij})/(1-\\rho_{ij})),\\; i \\neq\n    j. Note that all\nnatural parameters are individually unrestricted, but not jointly\nunrestricted (meaning that not all unrestricted vectors would give\npositive-definite matrices). Therefore, this parametrization should\nNOT be used for optimization. It is mostly used for deriving\napproximate confidence intervals on parameters following the\noptimization of an objective function. When value is\nnumeric(0), an uninitialized pdMat object, a one-sided\nformula, or a vector of character strings, object is returned\nas an uninitialized pdSymm object (with just some of its\nattributes and its class defined) and needs to have its coefficients\nassigned later, generally using the coef or matrix replacement\nfunctions. If value is an initialized pdMat object,\nobject will be constructed from\nas.matrix(value). Finally, if value is a numeric \nvector, it is assumed to represent the natural parameters of the\nunderlying positive-definite matrix.  \n","example_call":"pdNatural(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = parent.frame())"}
