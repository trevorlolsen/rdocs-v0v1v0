{"description":"This function is a constructor for the corLin class,\nrepresenting a linear spatial correlation structure. Letting\nd denote the range and n denote the nugget\neffect, the correlation between two observations a distance\nr < d apart is 1-(r/d) when no nugget effect\nis present and (1-n) (1 -(r/d)) when a nugget\neffect is assumed. If r \\geq d the correlation is\nzero. Objects created using this constructor must later be\ninitialized using the appropriate Initialize method. \n","example_call":"corLin(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, nugget = FALSE, metric = c(\"euclidean\","}
