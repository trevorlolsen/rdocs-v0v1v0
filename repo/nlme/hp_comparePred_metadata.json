{"description":"Predicted values are obtained at the specified values of\nprimary for each object. If either object1 or\nobject2 have a grouping structure\n(i.e. getGroups(object) is not NULL), predicted values\nare obtained for each group. When both objects determine groups, the\ngroup levels must be the same. If other covariates besides\nprimary are used in the prediction model, their group-wise averages\n(numeric covariates) or most frequent values (categorical covariates)\nare used to obtain the predicted values. The original observations are\nalso included in the returned object. \n","example_call":"comparePred(object1, object2, primary = NULL, minimum = min(primary),"}
