{"description":"This function is a constructor for the corSpatial class,\nrepresenting a spatial correlation structure. This class is \"virtual\",\nhaving four \"real\" classes, corresponding to specific spatial\ncorrelation structures, associated with it: corExp,\ncorGaus, corLin, corRatio, and\ncorSpher. The returned object will inherit from one of these\n\"real\" classes, determined by the type argument, and from the\n\"virtual\" corSpatial class. Objects created using this\nconstructor must later be initialized using the appropriate\nInitialize method. \n","example_call":"corSpatial(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, nugget = FALSE, type = c(\"spherical\","}
