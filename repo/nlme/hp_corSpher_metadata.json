{"description":"This function is a constructor for the corSpher class,\nrepresenting a spherical spatial correlation structure. Letting\nd denote the range and n denote the nugget\neffect, the correlation between two observations a distance\nr < d apart is 1-1.5(r/d)+0.5(r/d)^3 when no\nnugget effect is present and (1-n)\n    (1-1.5(r/d)+0.5(r/d)^3)  \nwhen a nugget effect is assumed. If r \\geq d the\ncorrelation is zero. Objects created using this constructor must later\nbe initialized using the appropriate Initialize method. \n","example_call":"corSpher(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, nugget = FALSE, metric = c(\"euclidean\","}
