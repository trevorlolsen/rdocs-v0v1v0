{"description":"Diagnostic plots for the linear mixed-effects fit are obtained. The\nform argument gives considerable flexibility in the type of\nplot specification. A conditioning expression (on the right side of a\n| operator) always implies that different panels are used for\neach level of the conditioning factor, according to a Trellis\ndisplay. If form is a one-sided formula, histograms of the\nvariable on the right hand side of the formula, before a |\noperator, are displayed (the Trellis function histogram is\nused). If form is two-sided and both its left and\nright hand side variables are numeric, scatter plots are displayed\n(the Trellis function xyplot is used). Finally, if form\nis two-sided and its left had side variable is a factor, box-plots of\nthe right hand side variable by the levels of the left hand side\nvariable are displayed (the Trellis function  bwplot is used). \n","example_call":"plot.lme(x, form = resid(., type = \"pearson\") ~ fitted(.), abline,"}
