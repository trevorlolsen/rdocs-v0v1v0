{"description":"This function is a constructor for the varFixed class,\nrepresenting a variance function with fixed variances. Letting v\ndenote the variance covariate defined in value, the variance\nfunction \\sigma^2(v) for this class is\n\\sigma^2(v)=|v|. The variance covariate v is\nevaluated once at initialization and remains fixed thereafter. No\ncoefficients are required to represent this variance function.\n","example_call":"varFixed(value = ~1)"}
