{"description":"An object of the groupedData class is constructed from the\nformula and data by attaching the formula as an\nattribute of the data, along with any of outer, inner,\nlabels, and units that are given.  If\norder.groups is TRUE the grouping factor is converted to\nan ordered factor with the ordering determined by\nFUN. Depending on the number of grouping levels and the type of\nprimary covariate, the returned object will be of one of three\nclasses: nfnGroupedData - numeric covariate, single level of\nnesting; nffGroupedData - factor covariate, single level of\nnesting; and nmGroupedData - multiple levels of\nnesting. Several modeling and plotting functions can use the formula\nstored with a groupedData object to construct default plots and\nmodels. \n","example_call":"groupedData(formula, data = NULL, order.groups = TRUE, FUN = function(x) max(x,"}
