{"description":"This function is a constructor for the corRatio class,\nrepresenting a rational quadratic spatial correlation structure. Letting\nd denote the range and n denote the nugget\neffect, the correlation between two observations a distance\nr apart is 1/(1+(r/d)^2) when no nugget effect\nis present and (1-n)/(1+(r/d)^2) when a\nnugget effect is  assumed. Objects created using this constructor need\nto be later initialized using the appropriate Initialize\nmethod. \n","example_call":"corRatio(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, nugget = FALSE, metric = c(\"euclidean\","}
