{"description":"This function is a constructor for the corGaus class,\nrepresenting a Gaussian spatial correlation structure. Letting\nd denote the range and n denote the nugget\neffect, the correlation between two observations a distance\nr apart is \\exp(-(r/d)^2) when no nugget\neffect is present and (1-n) \\exp(-(r/d)^2)\nwhen a nugget effect is assumed. Objects created using this\nconstructor must later be initialized using the appropriate\n'  Initialize method. \n","example_call":"corGaus(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, nugget = FALSE, metric = c(\"euclidean\","}
