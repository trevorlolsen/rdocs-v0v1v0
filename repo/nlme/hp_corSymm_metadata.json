{"description":"This function is a constructor for the corSymm class,\nrepresenting a general correlation structure. The internal\nrepresentation of this structure, in terms of unconstrained\nparameters, uses the spherical parametrization defined in Pinheiro and\nBates (1996).  Objects created using this constructor must later be\ninitialized using the  appropriate Initialize method. \n","example_call":"corSymm(value = numeric(0), form = ~1, fixed = FALSE)"}
