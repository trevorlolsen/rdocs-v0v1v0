{"description":"This function is a constructor for the pdCompSymm class,\nrepresenting a positive-definite matrix with compound symmetry\nstructure (constant diagonal and constant off-diagonal elements). The\nunderlying matrix is represented by 2 unrestricted parameters.\nWhen value is numeric(0), an uninitialized pdMat\nobject, a one-sided formula, or a vector of character strings,\nobject is returned  as an uninitialized pdCompSymm\nobject (with just some of its  attributes and its class defined) and\nneeds to have its coefficients assigned later, generally using the\ncoef or matrix replacement functions. If value is\nan initialized\npdMat object, object will be constructed from \nas.matrix(value). Finally, if value is a numeric vector\nof length 2, it is assumed to represent the unrestricted coefficients\nof the underlying positive-definite matrix.  \n","example_call":"pdCompSymm(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = parent.frame())"}
