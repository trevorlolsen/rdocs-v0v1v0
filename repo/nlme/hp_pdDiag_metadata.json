{"description":"This function is a constructor for the pdDiag class,\nrepresenting a diagonal positive-definite matrix. If the matrix\nassociated with object is of dimension n, it is\nrepresented by n unrestricted parameters, given by the logarithm\nof the square-root of the diagonal values. When value is\nnumeric(0), an uninitialized pdMat object, a one-sided\nformula, or a vector of character strings, object is returned\nas an uninitialized pdDiag object (with just some of its\nattributes and its class defined) and needs to have its coefficients\nassigned later, generally using the coef or matrix replacement\nfunctions. If value is an initialized pdMat object,\nobject will be constructed from\nas.matrix(value). Finally, if value is a numeric vector,\nit is assumed to represent the unrestricted coefficients of the\nunderlying positive-definite\nmatrix.  \n","example_call":"pdDiag(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = parent.frame())"}
