{"description":"This function is a constructor for the varExp class,\nrepresenting an exponential variance function structure. Letting\nv denote the variance covariate and \\sigma^2(v)\ndenote the variance function evaluated at v, the exponential\nvariance function is defined as \\sigma^2(v) = \\exp(2\\theta\n    v), where \\theta is the variance\nfunction coefficient. When a grouping factor is present, a different\n\\theta is used for each factor level.\n","example_call":"varExp(value = numeric(0), form = ~fitted(.), fixed = NULL)"}
