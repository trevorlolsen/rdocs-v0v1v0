{"description":"glue_safe() and glue_data_safe() differ from glue() and glue_data()\nin that the safe versions only look up symbols from an environment using\nget(). They do not execute any R code. This makes them suitable for use\nwith untrusted input, such as inputs in a Shiny application, where using the\nnormal functions would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n","example_call":"glue_data_safe(.x, ..., .envir = parent.frame())"}
