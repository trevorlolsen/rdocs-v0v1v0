{"description":"The rcrd class extends vctr. A rcrd is composed of 1 or more fields,\nwhich must be vectors of the same length. Is designed specifically for\nclasses that can naturally be decomposed into multiple vectors of the same\nlength, like POSIXlt, but where the organisation should be considered\nan implementation detail invisible to the user (unlike a data.frame).\n","example_call":"new_rcrd(fields, ..., class = character())"}
