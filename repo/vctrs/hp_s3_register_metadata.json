{"description":"Generally, the recommend way to register an S3 method is to use the\nS3Method() namespace directive (often generated automatically by the\n<U+2060>@export<U+2060> roxygen2 tag). However, this technique requires that the generic\nbe in an imported package, and sometimes you want to suggest a package,\nand only provide a method when that package is loaded. s3_register()\ncan be called from your package's .onLoad() to dynamically register\na method only if the generic's package is loaded.\n","example_call":"s3_register(generic, class, method = NULL)"}
