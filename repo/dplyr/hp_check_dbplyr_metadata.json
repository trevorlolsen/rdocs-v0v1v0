{"description":"In dplyr 0.7.0, a number of database and SQL functions moved from dplyr to\ndbplyr. The generic functions stayed in dplyr (since there is no easy way\nto conditionally import a generic from different packages), but many other\nSQL and database helper functions moved. If you have written a backend,\nthese functions generate the code you need to work with both dplyr 0.5.0\ndplyr 0.7.0.\n","example_call":"check_dbplyr()"}
