{"description":"Compare either the printed or str screen representation of\nR objects depending on which is estimated to produce the most useful\ndiff.  The selection process tries to minimize screen lines while maximizing\ndifferences shown subject to display constraints.  The decision algorithm is\nlikely to evolve over time, so do not rely on this function making\na particular selection under specific circumstances.  Instead, use\ndiffPrint or diffStr if you require one or the\nother output.\n","example_call":"diffObj(target, current, ...)"}
