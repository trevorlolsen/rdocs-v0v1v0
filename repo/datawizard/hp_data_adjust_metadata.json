{"description":"This function can be used to adjust the data for the effect of other\nvariables present in the dataset. It is based on an underlying fitting of\nregressions models, allowing for quite some flexibility, such as including\nfactors as random effects in mixed models (multilevel partialization),\ncontinuous variables as smooth terms in general additive models (non-linear\npartialization) and/or fitting these models under a Bayesian framework. The\nvalues returned by this function are the residuals of the regression models.\nNote that a regular correlation between two \"adjusted\" variables is\nequivalent to the partial correlation between them.\n","example_call":"data_adjust(data, effect = NULL, select = is.numeric, exclude = NULL,"}
