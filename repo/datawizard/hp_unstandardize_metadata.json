{"description":"Performs a standardization of data (z-scoring), i.e., centering and scaling,\nso that the data is expressed in terms of standard deviation (i.e., mean = 0,\nSD = 1) or Median Absolute Deviance (median = 0, MAD = 1). When applied to a\nstatistical model, this function extracts the dataset, standardizes it, and\nrefits the model with this standardized version of the dataset. The\nnormalize() function can also be used to scale all numeric variables within\nthe 0 - 1 range.\n\nFor model standardization, see standardize.default().\n","example_call":"unstandardize(x, ...)"}
