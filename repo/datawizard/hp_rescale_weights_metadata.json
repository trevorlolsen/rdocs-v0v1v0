{"description":"Most functions to fit multilevel and mixed effects models only\nallow to specify frequency weights, but not design (i.e. sampling or\nprobability) weights, which should be used when analyzing complex samples\nand survey data. rescale_weights() implements an algorithm proposed\nby Asparouhov (2006) and Carle (2009) to rescale design\nweights in survey data to account for the grouping structure of multilevel\nmodels, which then can be used for multilevel modelling.\n","example_call":"rescale_weights(data, by, probability_weights, nest = FALSE, group = NULL)"}
