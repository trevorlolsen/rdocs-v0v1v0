{"description":"Low-level symmetric encryption/decryption using the AES block cipher in CBC mode.\nThe key is a raw vector, for example a hash of some secret. When no shared\nsecret is available, a random key can be used which is exchanged via an\nasymmetric protocol such as RSA. See rsa_encrypt() for a worked example\nor encrypt_envelope() for a high-level wrapper combining AES and RSA.\n","example_call":"aes_gcm_encrypt(data, key, iv = rand_bytes(12))"}
