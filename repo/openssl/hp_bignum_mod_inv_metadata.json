{"description":"Basic operations for working with large integers. The bignum\nfunction converts a positive integer, string or raw vector into a bignum type.\nAll basic Arithmetic and Comparison operators such as\n+, -, *, ^, %%, %/%, ==,\n!=, <, <=, > and >= are implemented for\nbignum objects. The\nModular exponent\n(a^b %% m) can be calculated using bignum_mod_exp()\nwhen b is too large for calculating a^b directly.\n","example_call":"bignum_mod_inv(a, m)"}
