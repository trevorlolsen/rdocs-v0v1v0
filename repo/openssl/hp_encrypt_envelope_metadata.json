{"description":"An envelope\ncontains ciphertext along with an encrypted session key and optionally and initialization\nvector. The encrypt_envelope() generates a random IV and session-key which is\nused to encrypt the data with AES() stream cipher. The\nsession key itself is encrypted using the given RSA key (see rsa_encrypt()) and\nstored or sent along with the encrypted data. Each of these outputs is required to decrypt\nthe data with the corresponding private key.\n","example_call":"encrypt_envelope(data, pubkey = my_pubkey())"}
