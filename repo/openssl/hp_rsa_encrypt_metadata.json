{"description":"Asymmetric encryption and decryption with RSA. Because RSA can only encrypt messages\nsmaller than the size of the key, it is typically used only for exchanging a random\nsession-key. This session key is used to encipher arbitrary sized data via a stream\ncipher such as aes_cbc. See encrypt_envelope or pkcs7_encrypt for a high-level\nwrappers combining RSA and AES in this way.\n","example_call":"rsa_encrypt(data, pubkey = my_pubkey(), oaep = FALSE)"}
