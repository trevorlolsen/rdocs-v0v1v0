{"description":"The <80><9c>load<80><9d> represents the processes which are in a runnable\nstate, either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU (e.g. waiting for\ndisk I/O). On Windows this is emulated by using a Windows API that\nspawns a thread which keeps running in background and updates results\nevery 5 seconds, mimicking the UNIX behavior. Thus, on Windows, the\nfirst time this is called and for the next 5 seconds it will return a\nmeaningless (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) vector. The numbers returned only make sense\nif related to the number of CPU cores installed on the system. So, for\ninstance, a value of 3.14 on a system with 10 logical CPUs means that\nthe system load was 31.4% percent over the last N minutes.\n","example_call":"ps_loadavg()"}
