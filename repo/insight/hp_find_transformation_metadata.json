{"description":"This functions checks whether any transformation, such as log-\nor exp-transforming, was applied to the response variable (dependent\nvariable) in a regression formula. Currently, following patterns are\ndetected: log, log1p, log2, log10, exp, expm1, sqrt,\n<U+2060>log(x+<number>)<U+2060>, log-log, power (to 2nd power, like I(x^2)), and\ninverse (like 1/y).\n","example_call":"find_transformation(x, ...)"}
