{"description":"Collection of small helper functions. trim_ws() is an\nefficient function to trim leading and trailing whitespaces from character\nvectors or strings. n_unique() returns the number of unique values in a\nvector. has_single_value() is equivalent to n_unique() == 1 but is faster.\nsafe_deparse() is comparable to deparse1(), i.e. it can safely\ndeparse very long expressions into a single string. safe_deparse_symbol()\nonly deparses a substituted expressions when possible, which can be much faster\nthan deparse(substitute()) for those cases where substitute() returns no\nvalid object name.\n","example_call":"has_single_value(x, na.rm = FALSE)"}
