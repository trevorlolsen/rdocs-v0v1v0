{"description":"The get_predicted() function is a robust, flexible and user-friendly\nalternative to base R predict() function. Additional features and\nadvantages include availability of uncertainty intervals (CI), bootstrapping,\na more intuitive API and the support of more models than base R's predict()\nfunction. However, although the interface are simplified, it is still very\nimportant to read the documentation of the arguments. This is because making\n\"predictions\" (a lose term for a variety of things) is a non-trivial process,\nwith lots of caveats and complications. Read the 'Details' section for more\ninformation.\n","example_call":"get_predicted(x, ...)"}
