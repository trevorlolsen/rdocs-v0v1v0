{"description":"When evaluate() is evaluating code, the text output is diverted into\nan internal connection, and there is no way to flush that connection. This\nfunction provides a way to \"flush\" the connection so that any text output can\nbe immediately written out, and more importantly, the text handler\n(specified in the output_handler argument of evaluate()) will\nbe called, which makes it possible for users to know it when the code\nproduces text output using the handler.\n","example_call":"flush_console()"}
