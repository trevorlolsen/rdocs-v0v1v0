It captures messages, warnings, errors and\noutput, all correctly interleaved in the order in which they occured. It\nstores the final result, whether or not it should be visible, and the\ncontents of the current graphics device.\n","example_call":"evaluate(input, envir = parent.frame(), enclos = NULL, debug = FALSE,"}
