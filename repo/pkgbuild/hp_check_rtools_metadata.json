{"description":"To build binary packages on windows, Rtools (found at\nhttps://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) needs to be on\nthe path. The default installation process does not add it, so this\nscript finds it (looking first on the path, then in the registry).\nIt also checks that the version of rtools matches the version of R.\nhas_rtools() determines if Rtools is installed, caching the results.\nAfterward, run rtools_path() to find out where it's installed.\n","example_call":"check_rtools(debug = FALSE)"}
