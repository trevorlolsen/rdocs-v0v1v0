{"description":"For a given table one can specify which of the classifying factors to\nexpand by one or more levels to hold margins to be calculated.  One may for\nexample form sums and means over the first dimension and medians over the\nsecond.  The resulting table will then have two extra levels for the first\ndimension and one extra level for the second.  The default is to sum over\nall margins in the table.  Other possibilities may give results that\ndepend on the order in which the margins are computed.  This is flagged\nin the printed output from the function.\n","example_call":"addmargins(A, margin = seq_along(dim(A)), FUN = sum, quiet = FALSE)"}
