{"description":"In Rcpp versions prior to release 0.10.1 of November 2013,\nLdFlags and RcppLdFlags were used to return the required\nflags and options for the system linker to link to the Rcpp user\nlibrary. Since we no longer build or ship a user library, these\nfunctions now return an empty string. As of Rcpp release 0.12.19,\nthese functions are now deprecated.\n","example_call":"LdFlags()"}
