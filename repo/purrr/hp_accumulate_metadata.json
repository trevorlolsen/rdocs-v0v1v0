{"description":"accumulate() sequentially applies a 2-argument function to elements of a\nvector. Each application of the function uses the initial value or result\nof the previous application as the first argument. The second argument is\nthe next value of the vector. The results of each application are\nreturned in a list. The accumulation can optionally terminate before\nprocessing the whole vector in response to a done() signal returned by\nthe accumulation function.\n","example_call":"accumulate(.x, .f, ..., .init, .dir = c(\"forward\", \"backward\"),"}
