{"description":"array_branch() and array_tree() enable arrays to be\nused with purrr's functionals by turning them into lists. The\ndetails of the coercion are controlled by the margin\nargument. array_tree() creates an hierarchical list (a tree)\nthat has as many levels as dimensions specified in margin,\nwhile array_branch() creates a flat list (by analogy, a\nbranch) along all mentioned dimensions.\n","example_call":"array_tree(array, margin = NULL)"}
