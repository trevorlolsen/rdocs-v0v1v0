{"description":"These functions are variants of map() that iterate over multiple arguments\nsimultaneously. They are parallel in the sense that each input is processed\nin parallel with the others, not in the sense of multicore computing, i.e.\nthey share the same notion of \"parallel\" as base::pmax() and base::pmin().\n","example_call":"pmap_lgl(.l, .f, ..., .progress = FALSE)"}
