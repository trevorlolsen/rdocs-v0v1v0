{"description":"Simplification maintains a one-to-one correspondence between the input\nand output, implying that each element of x must contain a one element\nvector or a one-row data frame. If you don't want to maintain this\ncorrespondence, then you probably want either list_c()/list_rbind() or\nlist_flatten().\n","example_call":"list_simplify(x, ..., strict = TRUE, ptype = NULL)"}
