{"description":"as_label() converts (replaces) values of a variable (also of factors\nor character vectors) with their associated value labels. Might\nbe helpful for factor variables.\nFor instance, if you have a Gender variable with 0/1 value, and associated\nlabels are male/female, this function would convert all 0 to male and\nall 1 to female and returns the new variable as factor.\nas_character() does the same as as_label(), but returns\na character vector.\n","example_call":"as_label(x, ...)"}
