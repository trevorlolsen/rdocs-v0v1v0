{"description":"For (partially) labelled vectors, zap_labels() will replace\nall values that have a value label attribute with NA;\nzap_unlabelled(), as counterpart, will replace all values\nthat don't have a value label attribute with NA.\ndrop_labels() drops all value labels for unused values,\ni.e. values that are not present in a vector. fill_labels() is the\ncounterpart to drop_labels() and adds value labels to\na partially labelled vector, i.e. if not all values are\nlabelled, non-labelled values get labels.\n","example_call":"zap_labels(x, ...)"}
