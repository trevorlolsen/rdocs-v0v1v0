{"description":"This function adds labels as attribute (named \"labels\")\nto a variable or vector x, resp. to a set of variables in a\ndata frame or a list-object. A use-case is, for instance, the\nsjPlot-package, which supports labelled data and automatically\nassigns labels to axes or legends in plots or to be used in tables.\nval_labels() is intended for use within pipe-workflows and has a\ntidyverse-consistent syntax, including support for quasi-quotation\n(see 'Examples').\n","example_call":"set_labels(x, ..., labels, force.labels = FALSE, force.values = TRUE,"}
