{"description":"Calculate a SHA1 hash of an object. The main difference with\ndigest(x, algo = \"sha1\") is that sha1() will give the same hash on\n32-bit and 64-bit systems. Note that the results depends on the setting of\ndigits and zapsmall when handling floating point numbers. The\ncurrent defaults keep digits and zapsmall as large as possible\nwhile maintaining the same hash on 32 bit and 64 bit systems.\n","example_call":"sha1_attr_digest(x, digits = 14L, zapsmall = 7L, ..., algo = \"sha1\")"}
