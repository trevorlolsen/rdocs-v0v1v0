{"description":"The getVDigest function extends digest by allowing one to\nset a function that returns hash summaries as a character vector of the same length as the input. It also provides a performance advantage\nwhen repeated calls are necessary (e.g. applying a hash function repeatedly to an object). The returned function contains the same arguments as digest with the exception of the raw argument (see digest for more details).\n","example_call":"getVDigest(algo = c(\"md5\", \"sha1\", \"crc32\", \"sha256\", \"sha512\","}
