{"description":"This page documents a mechanism to generate relevant completions\nfrom a partially completed command line.  It is not intended to be\nuseful by itself, but rather in conjunction with other mechanisms that\nuse it as a backend.  The functions listed in the usage section\nprovide a simple control and query mechanism.  The actual interface\nconsists of a few unexported functions described further down.\n","example_call":"rc.options(...)"}
