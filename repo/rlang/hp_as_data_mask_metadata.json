{"description":"A data mask is an environment (or possibly\nmultiple environments forming an ancestry) containing user-supplied\nobjects. Objects in the mask have precedence over objects in the\nenvironment (i.e. they mask those objects). Many R functions\nevaluate quoted expressions in a data mask so these expressions can\nrefer to objects within the user data.\n","example_call":"as_data_mask(data)"}
