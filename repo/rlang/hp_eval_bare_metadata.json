{"description":"eval_bare() is a lower-level version of function base::eval().\nTechnically, it is a simple wrapper around the C function\nRf_eval(). You generally don't need to use eval_bare() instead\nof eval(). Its main advantage is that it handles stack-sensitive\ncalls (such as return(), on.exit() or parent.frame()) more\nconsistently when you pass an enviroment of a frame on the call\nstack.\n","example_call":"eval_bare(expr, env = parent.frame())"}
