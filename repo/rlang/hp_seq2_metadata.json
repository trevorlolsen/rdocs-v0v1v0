{"description":"These helpers take two endpoints and return the sequence of all\nintegers within that interval. For seq2_along(), the upper\nendpoint is taken from the length of a vector. Unlike\nbase::seq(), they return an empty vector if the starting point is\na larger integer than the end point.\n","example_call":"seq2(from, to)"}
