{"description":"new_box() is similar to base::I() but it protects a value by\nwrapping it in a scalar list rather than by adding an attribute.\nunbox() retrieves the boxed value. is_box() tests whether an\nobject is boxed with optional class. as_box() ensures that a\nvalue is wrapped in a box. as_box_if() does the same but only if\nthe value matches a predicate.\n","example_call":"new_box(.x, class = NULL, ...)"}
