{"description":"These functions dispatch internally with methods for functions,\nformulas and frames. If called with a missing argument, the\nenvironment of the current evaluation frame is returned. If you\ncall get_env() with an environment, it acts as the identity\nfunction and the environment is simply returned (this helps\nsimplifying code when writing generic functions for environments).\n","example_call":"get_env(env, default = NULL)"}
