{"description":"This is a tool for advanced users. It captures dots, processes\nunquoting and splicing operators, and evaluates them.

You can process\nspliced objects manually, perhaps with a custom predicate (see\nflatten_if()).\n","example_call":"dots_values(..., .ignore_empty = c(\"trailing\", \"none\", \"all\"),"}
