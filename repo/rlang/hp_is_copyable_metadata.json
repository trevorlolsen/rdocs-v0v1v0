{"description":"When an object is modified, R generally copies it (sometimes\nlazily) to enforce value semantics.\nHowever, some internal types are uncopyable. If you try to copy\nthem, either with <U+2060><-<U+2060> or by argument passing, you actually create\nreferences to the original object rather than actual\ncopies. Modifying these references can thus have far reaching side\neffects.\n","example_call":"is_copyable(x)"}
