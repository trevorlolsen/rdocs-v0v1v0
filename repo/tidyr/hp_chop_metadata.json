{"description":"Chopping and unchopping preserve the width of a data frame, changing its\nlength. chop() makes df shorter by converting rows within each group\ninto list-columns. unchop() makes df longer by expanding list-columns\nso that each element of the list-column gets its own row in the output.\nchop() and unchop() are building blocks for more complicated functions\n(like unnest(), unnest_longer(), and unnest_wider()) and are generally\nmore suitable for programming than interactive data analysis.\n","example_call":"chop(data, cols, ..., error_call = current_env())"}
