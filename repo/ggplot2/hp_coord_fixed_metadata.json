{"description":"A fixed scale coordinate system forces a specified ratio between the\nphysical representation of data units on the axes. The ratio represents the\nnumber of units on the y-axis equivalent to one unit on the x-axis. The\ndefault, ratio = 1, ensures that one unit on the x-axis is the same\nlength as one unit on the y-axis. Ratios higher than one make units on the\ny axis longer than units on the x-axis, and vice versa. This is similar to\nMASS::eqscplot(), but it works for all types of graphics.\n","example_call":"coord_fixed(ratio = 1, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, expand = TRUE,"}
