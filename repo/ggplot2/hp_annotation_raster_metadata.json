{"description":"This is a special version of geom_raster() optimised for static\nannotations that are the same in every panel. These annotations will not\naffect scales (i.e. the x and y axes will not grow to cover the range\nof the raster, and the raster must already have its own colours). This\nis useful for adding bitmap images.\n","example_call":"annotation_raster(raster, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, interpolate = FALSE)"}
