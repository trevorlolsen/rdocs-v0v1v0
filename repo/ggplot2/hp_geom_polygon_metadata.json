{"description":"Polygons are very similar to paths (as drawn by geom_path())\nexcept that the start and end points are connected and the inside is\ncoloured by fill. The group aesthetic determines which cases\nare connected together into a polygon. From R 3.6 and onwards it is possible\nto draw polygons with holes by providing a subgroup aesthetic that\ndifferentiates the outer ring points from those describing holes in the\npolygon.\n","example_call":"geom_polygon(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = \"identity\", position = \"identity\","}
