{"description":"This set of geom, stat, and coord are used to visualise simple feature (sf)\nobjects. For simple plots, you will only need geom_sf() as it\nuses stat_sf() and adds coord_sf() for you. geom_sf() is\nan unusual geom because it will draw different geometric objects depending\non what simple features are present in the data: you can get points, lines,\nor polygons.\nFor text and labels, you can use geom_sf_text() and geom_sf_label().\n","example_call":"NULL"}
