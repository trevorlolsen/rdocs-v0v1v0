{"description":"Dodging preserves the vertical position of an geom while adjusting the\nhorizontal position. position_dodge() requires the grouping variable to be\nbe specified in the global or <U+2060>geom_*<U+2060> layer. Unlike position_dodge(),\nposition_dodge2() works without a grouping variable in a layer.\nposition_dodge2() works with bars and rectangles, but is\nparticularly useful for arranging box plots, which\ncan have variable widths.\n","example_call":"position_dodge(width = NULL, preserve = \"total\")"}
