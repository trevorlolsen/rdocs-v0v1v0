{"description":"This guide is a version of the guide_legend() guide for binned scales. It\ndiffers in that it places ticks correctly between the keys, and sports a\nsmall axis to better show the binning. Like guide_legend() it can be used\nfor all non-position aesthetics though colour and fill defaults to\nguide_coloursteps(), and it will merge aesthetics together into the same\nguide if they are mapped in the same way.\n","example_call":"guide_bins(title = waiver(), theme = NULL, position = NULL, direction = NULL,"}
