{"description":"This function adds geoms to a plot, but unlike a typical geom function,\nthe properties of the geoms are not mapped from variables of a data frame,\nbut are instead passed in as vectors. This is useful for adding small annotations\n(such as text labels) or if you have your data in vectors, and for some\nreason don't want to put them in a data frame.\n","example_call":"annotate(geom, x = NULL, y = NULL, xmin = NULL, xmax = NULL,"}
