{"description":"The point geom is used to create scatterplots. The scatterplot is most\nuseful for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables.\nIt can be used to compare one continuous and one categorical variable, or\ntwo categorical variables, but a variation like geom_jitter(),\ngeom_count(), or geom_bin_2d() is usually more\nappropriate. A bubblechart is a scatterplot with a third variable\nmapped to the size of points.\n","example_call":"geom_point(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = \"identity\", position = \"identity\","}
