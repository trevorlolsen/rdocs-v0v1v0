{"description":"The guide system has been overhauled to use the ggproto infrastructure to\naccommodate guide extensions with the same flexibility as layers, scales and\nother ggplot2 objects. In rewriting, the old S3 system has become defunct,\nmeaning that the previous methods for guides have been superseded by ggproto\nmethods. As a fallback option, the generics, but not the methods, that the\nprevious S3 system used are encapsulated in the GuideOld ggproto class.\n","example_call":"old_guide(guide)"}
