{"description":"The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) provides an alternative\nvisualisation of distribution. Compared to other visualisations that rely on\ndensity (like geom_histogram()), the ECDF doesn't require any\ntuning parameters and handles both continuous and categorical variables.\nThe downside is that it requires more training to accurately interpret,\nand the underlying visual tasks are somewhat more challenging.\n","example_call":"stat_ecdf(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = \"step\", position = \"identity\","}
