{"description":"There are two types of bar charts: geom_bar() and geom_col().\ngeom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of\ncases in each group (or if the weight aesthetic is supplied, the sum\nof the weights). If you want the heights of the bars to represent values\nin the data, use geom_col() instead. geom_bar() uses stat_count() by\ndefault: it counts the number of cases at each x position. geom_col()\nuses stat_identity(): it leaves the data as is.\n","example_call":"geom_bar(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = \"count\", position = \"stack\","}
