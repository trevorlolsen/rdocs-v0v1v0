{"description":"The rbind_pages function is used to combine a list of data frames into a single\ndata frame. This is often needed when working with a JSON API that limits the amount\nof data per request. If we need more data than what fits in a single request, we need to\nperform multiple requests that each retrieve a fragment of data, not unlike pages in a\nbook. In practice this is often implemented using a page parameter in the API. The\nrbind_pages function can be used to combine these pages back into a single dataset.\n","example_call":"rbind_pages(pages)"}
