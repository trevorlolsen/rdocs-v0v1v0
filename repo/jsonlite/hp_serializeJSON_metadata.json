{"description":"The serializeJSON() and unserializeJSON() functions convert between\nR objects to JSON data. Instead of using a class based mapping like\ntoJSON() and fromJSON(), the serialize functions base the encoding\nschema on the storage type, and capture all data and attributes from any object.\nThereby the object can be restored almost perfectly from its JSON representation, but\nthe resulting JSON output is very verbose. Apart from environments, all standard storage\ntypes are supported.\n","example_call":"serializeJSON(x, digits = 8, pretty = FALSE)"}
