{"description":"One of the most pernicious challenges to debug is when a test runs fine\nin your test suite, but fails when you run it interactively (or similarly,\nit fails randomly when running your tests in parallel). One of the most\ncommon causes of this problem is accidentally changing global state in a\nprevious test (e.g. changing an option, an environment variable, or the\nworking directory). This is hard to debug, because it's very hard to figure\nout which test made the change.\n","example_call":"set_state_inspector(callback)"}
