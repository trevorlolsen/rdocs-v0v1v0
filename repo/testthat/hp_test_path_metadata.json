{"description":"Many tests require some external file (e.g. a .csv if you're testing a\ndata import function) but the working directory varies depending on the way\nthat you're running the test (e.g. interactively, with devtools::test(),\nor with <U+2060>R CMD check<U+2060>). test_path() understands these variations and\nautomatically generates a path relative to tests/testthat, regardless of\nwhere that directory might reside relative to the current working directory.\n","example_call":"test_path(...)"}
