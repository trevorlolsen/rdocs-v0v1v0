{"description":"Safely retry a request until it succeeds, as defined by the terminate_on\nparameter, which by default means a response for which http_error()\nis FALSE. Will also retry on error conditions raised by the underlying curl code,\nbut if the last retry still raises one, RETRY will raise it again with\nstop().\nIt is designed to be kind to the server: after each failure\nrandomly waits up to twice as long. (Technically it uses exponential\nbackoff with jitter, using the approach outlined in\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/.)\nIf the server returns status code 429 and specifies a retry-after value, that\nvalue will be used instead, unless it's smaller than pause_min.\n","example_call":"RETRY(verb, url = NULL, config = list(), ..., body = NULL,"}
