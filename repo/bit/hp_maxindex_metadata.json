{"description":"For is.booltype objects the term length is ambiguous. \nFor example the length of which corresponds to the sum of logical.\nThe generic maxindex gives length(logical) for all booltypes.\nThe generic poslength gives the number of positively selected elements, i.e. sum(logical) for all booltypes \n(and gives NA if NAs are present).\n","example_call":"maxindex(x, ...)"}
