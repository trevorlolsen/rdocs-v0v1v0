{"description":"Fast aggregation functions for booltype vectors. namely bit, all, any, anyNA,\nmin, max, range,\nsum and summary.\nNow all boolean summaries (except for anyNA because the generic does not allow it) have an optional range argument to restrict the range of evalution.\nNote that the boolean summaries have meaning and return values differing from logical aggregation functions: they treat NA as FALSE, \nmin, max and range give the minimum and maximum positions of TRUE, summary returns counts of FALSE,  TRUE and the range.\nNote that you can force the boolean interpretation by calling the booltype method explicitely on any booltypes input, e.g. min.booltype(), see the examples.\n","example_call":"anyNA.booltype(x, ...)"}
