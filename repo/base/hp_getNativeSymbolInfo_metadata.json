{"description":"This finds and returns a description of one or more dynamically loaded\nor <U+2018>exported<U+2019> built-in native symbols.  For each name, it\nreturns information about the name of the symbol, the library in which\nit is located and, if available, the number of arguments it expects\nand by which interface it should be called (i.e .Call,\n.C, .Fortran, or\n.External). Additionally, it returns the address of the\nsymbol and this can be passed to other C routines.  Specifically, this\nprovides a way to explicitly share symbols between different\ndynamically loaded package libraries.  Also, it provides a way to\nquery where symbols were resolved, and aids diagnosing strange\nbehavior associated with dynamic resolution.\n","example_call":"getNativeSymbolInfo(name, PACKAGE, unlist = TRUE, withRegistrationInfo = FALSE)"}
