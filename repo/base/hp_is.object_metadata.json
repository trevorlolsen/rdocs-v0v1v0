{"description":"A function mostly for internal use.  It returns TRUE if the\nobject x has the R internal OBJECT bit set, and\nFALSE otherwise.  The OBJECT bit is set when a\n\"class\" attribute is added and removed when that attribute is\nremoved, so this is a very efficient way to check if an object has a\nclass attribute.  (S4 objects always should.)\n","example_call":"is.object(x)"}
