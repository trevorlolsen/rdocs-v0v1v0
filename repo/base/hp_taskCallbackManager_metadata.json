{"description":"This provides an entirely R-language mechanism\nfor managing callbacks or actions  that are invoked at\nthe conclusion of each top-level task.  Essentially,\nwe register a single R function from this manager\nwith the underlying, native\ntask-callback mechanism and this function handles invoking the other\nR callbacks under the control of the manager.\nThe manager consists of a collection of functions that access shared\nvariables to manage the list of user-level callbacks.\n","example_call":"taskCallbackManager(handlers = list(), registered = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)"}
