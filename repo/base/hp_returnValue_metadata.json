{"description":"A call to trace allows you to insert debugging code (e.g., a\ncall to browser or recover) at chosen\nplaces in any function.  A call to untrace cancels the tracing.\nSpecified methods can be traced the same way, without tracing all\ncalls to the generic function.  Trace code (tracer) can be any\nR expression.  Tracing can be temporarily turned on or off globally\nby calling tracingState.\n","example_call":"returnValue(default = NULL)"}
