{"description":"There are two ways to represent missing values in factors: in the values\nand in the levels. NAs in the values are most useful for data analysis\n(since is.na() returns what you expect), but because the NA is not\nexplicitly recorded in the levels, there's no way to control its position\n(it's almost always displayed last or not at all). Putting the NAs in the levels allows\nyou to control its display, at the cost of losing accurate is.na()\nreporting.\n","example_call":"fct_na_level_to_value(f, extra_levels = NULL)"}
