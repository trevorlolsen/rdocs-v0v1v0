{"description":"A transformation encapsulates a transformation and its inverse, as well\nas the information needed to create pleasing breaks and labels. The breaks()\nfunction is applied on the un-transformed range of the data, and the\nformat() function takes the output of the breaks() function and returns\nwell-formatted labels. Transformations may also include the derivatives of the\ntransformation and its inverse, but are not required to.\n","example_call":"trans_new(name, transform, inverse, d_transform = NULL, d_inverse = NULL,"}
