{"description":"This algorithm starts by looking for integer powers of base. If that\ndoesn't provide enough breaks, it then looks for additional intermediate\nbreaks which are integer multiples of integer powers of base. If that fails\n(which it can for very small ranges), we fall back to extended_breaks()\n","example_call":"breaks_log(n = 5, base = 10)"}
