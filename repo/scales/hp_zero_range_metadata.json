{"description":"The machine epsilon is the difference between 1.0 and the next number\nthat can be represented by the machine. By default, this function\nuses epsilon * 1000 as the tolerance. First it scales the values so that\nthey have a mean of 1, and then it checks if the difference between\nthem is larger than the tolerance.\n","example_call":"zero_range(x, tol = 1000 * .Machine$double.eps)"}
