{"description":"isSymmetric tests whether its argument is a symmetric square\nmatrix, by default tolerating some numerical fuzz and requiring\nsymmetric [dD]imnames in addition to symmetry in the\nmathematical sense.  isSymmetric is a generic function in\nbase, which has a method for traditional\nmatrices of implicit class \"matrix\".\nMethods are defined here for various proper and virtual classes\nin Matrix, so that isSymmetric works for all objects\ninheriting from virtual class \"Matrix\".\n","example_call":"isSymmetric(object, ...)"}
