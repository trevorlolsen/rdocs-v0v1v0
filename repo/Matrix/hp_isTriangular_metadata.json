{"description":"isTriangular and isDiagonal test whether their argument\nis a triangular or diagonal matrix, respectively.  Unlike the analogous\nisSymmetric, these two functions are generically\nfrom Matrix rather than base.  Hence Matrix\ndefines methods for traditional matrices of implicit class\n\"matrix\" in addition to matrices inheriting from\nvirtual class \"Matrix\".\n","example_call":"isTriangular(object, upper = NA, ...)"}
